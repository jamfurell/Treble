## CODE CAPTURE

## ARISING PROBLEM
Our group originally planned on using the lastFM API to fetch data for songs but we found that we could not access the album artwork/image. Thankfully, we were able to find another API (deezer API) that provided all the information we needed for our application. 
Our application primarily used BOOTSTRAP to style our page but there were times where style cutomization proved to be difficult.
